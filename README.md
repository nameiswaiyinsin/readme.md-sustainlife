# Project 1 - HTML & CSS Essentials 

Welcome to [Sustain Life](https://nameiswaiyinsin.github.io/sustainlife/) README.md ! 


## Brief
[Sustain Life](https://nameiswaiyinsin.github.io/sustainlife/) is a website for people who would like to live a more sustainable lifestyle through gaining information and inspiration about repairing, maintaining and being creative with their own belongings! They can also share and connect by submitting their own sustainability journeys and projects! 

The last number of years has seen a rise in communities finding ways to be more sustainable and be kinder to the earth by reducing comsumption and increasing the lifecycle of the products they already own. By learning to properly maintain, repair and repurpose your own belongings, you can prolong the lifecycle of your items and maximise its use before deteoriation and being disposed off which is much kinder to our environment. The aim of this website is to facilitate this learning by curating a video library of various topics to maintain, repair items and sustainable gifting etiquette, while aiming to be a fun and engaging for the audience. 

This site allows people to learn, connect and have fun with their sustainability journeys and projects!

### Wireframe

I designed my wireframe on [Wireframe.cc] (https://wireframe.cc/). The final site may differ from the wireframe templates due to developments in the building process.

<br>
Note: Due to time constraint, I was not able to digitally design the wireframe for the rest of the website. I drew it on paper before starting to build my website, hoping I would have time to design the final wireframe, but unfortunately I wasn't able to do that.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme I chose was inspired by earth's natural colours such as green, brown and charcoal in various shades. It reflects the natural, environmentally conscious theme of the website. Black and white were also used as standard colours to add clarity and familiarity for users.

### Typography
Two fonts were used for the website: 
<ul>
<li>h1 and h2 used Josefin Sans, sans-serif</li>
<li>Body font used Montserrat, sans-serif</li>
</ul>

The fonts were sourced from Google Fonts.
The fonts were chosen as they are complementary with each other aesthetically and easy to read for accessibility.


## Testing

### HTML & CSS Validator
At the and of the project I used two websites to validate all code:
<ul>
<li>W3C CSS Validator to validate CSS https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/</li>
<li>Nu Html Checker to test HTML https://validator.w3.org/</li>

<li>Go to project repository, navigate to the Settings tab.</li>
<li>Select Pages tab from the left hand menu.</li>
<li>In Source section, drop-down the menu and select the Main Branch and click Save.</li>
<li>After the page has refreshed, a ribbon will display indicating the successful deployment of the site and link to the live page.</li>
<li>The live site can be found using the following URL - https://github.com/nameiswaiyinsin/sustainlife</li>
</ol>



## How to clone and deploy project to use for yourself
To make a copy or ‘fork’ the repository -
<ol>
<li>Log into GitHub and locate repository</li>
<li>On the right hand side of the page select the ‘fork’ option to create and copy of the original</li>
</ol>

To create a Local Clone
<ol>
<li>Under repository name, click on the Code tab</li>
</li>In the clone box, HTTPS tab, click on the Clipboard Icon in your IED open GitBash</li>
</li>Change the current working directory to the location you want the cloned directory to be made</li>
</li>Type ‘git clone’ and paste the URL copied from GitHub</li>
</li>Press Enter and the local clone will be created</li>
</ol>

## Bugs detected 
<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS validator errors are now all fixed and validated</li>
<li>My padding was wrongly done in some part of the website and unicorn revealer was recommended to me and I found it very useful and will be using it in my future projects until I get a better understanding of the layout. </li>
<li>Media Queries at different sizes need to be taken account of and I find that I will start building for mobile first and then add media queries for wider screen sizes.</li>
<li>The padding for the youtube videos were quite hard to figure out as the videos were stuck together. I then made the width 100% and it added appropriate separation in the videos.</li>
<li>The height of the first embedded Tiktok video in the Repurpose and Gifting section part of tutorials.html is not on the same level of alignment as the rest of the videos, it sits slightly below and unfortunately, I have not been able to figure it out yet. I hope to solve this bug in the future. </li>
<li>I learnt through the HTML Validator that the button type cannot be a descendant of an anchor and hence I had to change my button to a paragraph and style it as a class in CSS to look like the button.</li>
<li>I have to figure out how to align my boxes in the contact form.</li>
</ul>

## Future Functionalities
Due to time and resource constraints, I was not able to implement everything that I had envisioned and will add future features later as my skills grow and refine.

Future Functionalities I would like to implement:
<ul>
<li>A feature within the main gallery allowing the users to view the photos individually when clicked on, with zoom capabilities.</li>
<li>Add a tab in the Tutorials page, where you can click on either Repairing Tutorials, Repurposing Tutorials and Gifting Tutorials. When the user clicks on the tab they would like to view at the top of the page, they would be brought to the section of the page where they can watch the tutorials they need.</li>
<li>Add a scroll up button at the bottom of the screen on the Tutorials page so the user can be scrolled up with a click of a button instead of having to scroll up manually themselves.</li>
<li>Create a 404 error page.</li>
<li>Fix all bugs and Performance rating that I couldn't fix due to time restraint.</li>
<ul>
